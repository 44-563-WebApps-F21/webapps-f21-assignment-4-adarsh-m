    <h3>A Woman of No Importance</h3>
    <h5>_The Terrace at Hunstanton Chase_</h5>
<h6 class="Name LADY_CAROLINE">LADY CAROLINE.</h6>  <p>I believe this is the first English country house you
have stayed at, Miss Worsley?</p>

<h6 class="Name Hester">HESTER.</h6>  <p>Yes, Lady Caroline.</p>

<h6 class="Name LADY_CAROLINE">LADY CAROLINE.</h6>  <p>You have no country houses, I am told, in America?</p>

<h6 class="Name Hester">HESTER.</h6>  <p>We have not many.</p>

<h6 class="Name LADY_CAROLINE">LADY CAROLINE.</h6>  <p>Have you any country?  What we should call country?</p>

<h6 class="Name Hester">HESTER.</h6>  <p>[_Smiling_.]  We have the largest country in the world, Lady
<h6 class="Name LADY_CAROLINE">Caroline.</h6>  They used to tell us at school that some of our states are as
big as France and England put together.</p>

<h6 class="Name LADY_CAROLINE">LADY CAROLINE.</h6>  <p>Ah! you must find it very draughty, I should fancy.
[_To_ SIR JOHN.]  John, you should have your muffler.  What is the use of
my always knitting mufflers for you if you won’t wear them?</p>

<h6 class="Name SIR_JOHN">SIR JOHN.</h6>  <p>I am quite warm, Caroline, I assure you.</p>

<h6 class="Name LADY_CAROLINE">LADY CAROLINE.</h6>  <p>I think not, John.  Well, you couldn’t come to a more
charming place than this, Miss Worsley, though the house is excessively
damp, quite unpardonably damp, and dear Lady Hunstanton is sometimes a
little lax about the people she asks down here.  [_To_ SIR JOHN.]  Jane
mixes too much.  Lord Illingworth, of course, is a man of high
distinction.  It is a privilege to meet him.  And that member of
Parliament, Mr. Kettle—</p>

<h6 class="Name SIR_JOHN">SIR JOHN.</h6>  <p>Kelvil, my love, Kelvil.</p>

<h6 class="Name LADY_CAROLINE">LADY CAROLINE.</h6>  <p>He must be quite respectable.  One has never heard his
name before in the whole course of one’s life, which speaks volumes for a
man, nowadays.  But Mrs. Allonby is hardly a very suitable person.</p>

<h6 class="Name Hester">HESTER.</h6>  <p>I dislike Mrs. Allonby.  I dislike her more than I can say.</p>

<h6 class="Name LADY_CAROLINE">LADY CAROLINE.</h6>  <p>I am not sure, Miss Worsley, that foreigners like
yourself should cultivate likes or dislikes about the people they are
invited to meet.  Mrs. Allonby is very well born.  She is a niece of Lord
Brancaster’s.  It is said, of course, that she ran away twice before she
was married.  But you know how unfair people often are.  I myself don’t
believe she ran away more than once.</p>

<h6 class="Name Hester">HESTER.</h6>  <p>Mr. Arbuthnot is very charming.</p>

<h6 class="Name LADY_CAROLINE">LADY CAROLINE.</h6>  <p>Ah, yes! the young man who has a post in a bank.  Lady
Hunstanton is most kind in asking him here, and Lord Illingworth seems to
have taken quite a fancy to him.  I am not sure, however, that Jane is
right in taking him out of his position.  In my young days, Miss Worsley,
one never met any one in society who worked for their living.  It was not
considered the thing.</p>

<h6 class="Name Hester">HESTER.</h6>  <p>In America those are the people we respect most.</p>

<h6 class="Name LADY_CAROLINE">LADY CAROLINE.</h6>  <p>I have no doubt of it.</p>

<h6 class="Name Hester">HESTER.</h6>  <p>Mr. Arbuthnot has a beautiful nature!  He is so simple, so
sincere.  He has one of the most beautiful natures I have ever come
across.  It is a privilege to meet _him_.</p>

<h6 class="Name LADY_CAROLINE">LADY CAROLINE.</h6>  <p>It is not customary in England, Miss Worsley, for a young
lady to speak with such enthusiasm of any person of the opposite sex.
English women conceal their feelings till after they are married.  They
show them then.</p>
