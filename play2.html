<h6 class="Name Hester">HESTER.</h6>  <p>Do you, in England, allow no friendship to exist between a young
man and a young girl?</p>

[_Enter_ LADY HUNSTANTON, _followed by Footman with shawls and a
cushion_.]

<h6 class="Name LADY_CAROLINE">LADY CAROLINE.</h6>  <p>We think it very inadvisable.  Jane, I was just saying
what a pleasant party you have asked us to meet.  You have a wonderful
power of selection.  It is quite a gift.</p>

<h6 class="Name Hester">HESTER.</h6>  <p>Dear Caroline, how kind of you!  I think we all do fit
in very nicely together.  And I hope our charming American visitor will
carry back pleasant recollections of our English country life.  [_To
Footman_.]  The cushion, there, Francis.  And my shawl.  The Shetland.
Get the Shetland.  [_Exit Footman for shawl_.]</p>
